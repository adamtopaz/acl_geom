# Abstract group laws for the group-chunk route

This module assumes everywhere-defined multiplication and inverse operations
and constructs an abstract group from their total identities.  It does not
construct these operations from generic finite correspondences, extend
partial rational operations, or algebraize them to a group scheme.  Those
steps of blueprint Theorem `rational-group-chunk` remain open (issue #12):

* `RationalGroupChunk` records associativity and the two generic inverse
  identities in their everywhere-defined algebraic form;
* `RationalGroupChunk.toGroup` constructs the canonical group structure,
  proving rather than assuming the identity laws;
* `TranslationGroupChunk` records the faithful chart of left translations
  in the automorphism group of the normalized function field;
* `TranslationGroupChunk.translationHom` is that chart as an injective group
  homomorphism.

The historical M4a route is frozen pending the audit re-plan (#19).  These
abstract identities remain available as bookkeeping; no rational group-chunk
theorem follows from them without the missing geometric construction.

**Status:** abstract group-law bookkeeping; blueprint Theorem 8.2 is open (#12).

This module is part of the formalization of the Evans–Hrushovski–Gismatullin
reconstruction theorem; the source of truth is `sources/blueprint.tex`.
