# The perfected base and the pullback equation

Toward the perfection order isomorphism
`𝒢(K/k) ≃o 𝒢(K^perf/k^perf)` (blueprint Prop `perf-lattice`), this file
provides:

* `Perfection.basePerf`: the compatible perfected base `k^i` inside the
  perfection of `K` (blueprint eq. 20.1);
* `Perfection.perfIF`: `M^perf` as an intermediate field of the perfection
  over the perfected base, for a closed `M ∈ 𝒢(K/k)`;
* `Perfection.incl_mem_perfIF_iff`: the pullback equation (5.1) —
  intersecting `M^perf` with (the image of) `K` recovers `M`;
* `Perfection.isRAC_perfIF` / `Perfection.perfClosed`: `M^perf` is
  relatively algebraically closed in the perfection;
* `Perfection.comapClosed` and equation (5.2)
  (`perfClosed_comapClosed`): every closed subextension of the perfection
  is the perfection of its pullback;
* `Perfection.latticeIso`: the perfection order isomorphism
  `𝒢(K/k) ≃o 𝒢(K^perf/k^perf)` — checklist item P2.

Still to come (P3): the integral Frobenius action fixing every atom.

This module is part of the formalization of the Evans–Hrushovski–Gismatullin
reconstruction theorem; the source of truth is `sources/blueprint.tex`.

**Status:** in progress (M2, checklist P2).
