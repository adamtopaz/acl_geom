# Perfections and perfected subfields

Following blueprint §type-correct statement and §Foundation III:

* `Perfection K`: a chosen perfect closure of `K`, bundled as a perfect field
  `carrier` with a `p`-radical inclusion `incl : K →+* carrier` satisfying
  `IsPerfectClosure`, uniform in the characteristic exponent (`p = 1` in
  characteristic zero);
* `Perfection.perfSubfield M`: the perfected subfield `M^perf` of a subfield
  `M ≤ K`, with the public membership criterion
  `x ∈ M^perf ↔ ∃ n, ∃ m ∈ M, x ^ p ^ n = incl m`
  (`mem_perfSubfield_iff`), monotonicity, and the pullback computation
  `incl_mem_perfSubfield_iff`.

The perfection order isomorphism between closed lattices (P2) and the
Frobenius action (P3) build on this in `AclGeom.Perfection.Lattice`.

This module is part of the formalization of the Evans–Hrushovski–Gismatullin
reconstruction theorem; the source of truth is `sources/blueprint.tex`.

**Status:** in progress (M2, checklist P1).

/-- A chosen perfection of a field `K` (blueprint §type-correct statement):
a perfect field together with a `p`-radical inclusion of `K` making it a
perfect closure, where `p` is the characteristic exponent — `p = 1` in
characteristic zero, in which case `incl` is an isomorphism. Working with
this bundle keeps every statement uniform in the characteristic. -/
